# Monitor the Monitor

[Monitor the Monitor](https://justdesmarais.github.io/Monitor-the-Monitor/) is an application to help users track their most highly anticipated upcoming video games!  Not only does it allow users to track the release dates of yet-to-be released games, but also functionally serves as a personal to-do list of games they would like to play.

Users can search for games and add them to their personal Favorites List for easy recall in later uses. If a user wants to remove the game from their Favorites List, all they have to do is click the remove button (X) to have it taken off of their list.

The application was built by [Justin Desmarais](https://github.com/JustDesmarais) and [Keng Thao](https://github.com/Kthao29) using the following technologies:

- Bulma CSS Library for design
- JQuery JavaScript Library for JavaScript functions
- DayJS API to pull and format date information
- RAWG.io API to pull video game information from the RAWG.io database
