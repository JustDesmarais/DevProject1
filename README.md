{Insert Name} is an application to help users track their most highly anticipated upcoming video games!  Not only does it allow users to track the release dates of yet-to-be released games, but also functionally serves as a personal to-do list of games they would like to play.

Users can search for games and add them to their personal Favorites List for easy recall in later uses. If a user wants to remove the game from their Favorites List, all they have to do is click the remove button (X) to have it taken off of their list
